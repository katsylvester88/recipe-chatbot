I am happy to say I found it. You could add mushrooms, green pepper, olives, etc. to this dish for added variety, but I like it just the way it is! This makes a great family meal...just add a tossed salad and some garlic bread, and dinner is ready in about an hour.        \n","Tags: Meat, Kid Friendly, < 60 Mins, Oven, Easy\n","Ingredients: ground beef, garlic, mild cheddar cheese, oregano\n","Steps: Preheat oven to 350., Cook noodles in boiling water; drain., Meanwhile, brown ground beef and garlic over medium heat; drain., Combine browned ground beef, spaghetti sauce, and oregano., Spray a casserole dish with cooking spray., Place 1/3 of noodles in bottom of dish., Top with 1/3 of spaghetti sauce mixture, and 1/3 of cheese., Repeat twice, ending with cheddar cheese., Bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes.\n","===RECIPE END===\n","===RECIPE START===\n","Title: Zucchini Lasagna (Lasagne) - Low Carb\n","Description: Great for anyone going low carb OR who has so many zucchini, they don't know what to do!! :) We found the sauce to be very mild. I think it would be better with twice as much garlic. I boiled my zucchini slices for about 3 minutes so they were partially cooked. I wanted to make sure they were soft in the finished dish or I knew the kids wouldn't eat them. ;) The cottage cheese provides a slightly tangy note. I think we would have preferred ricotta, but that is personal taste. I use my 11x7 baking dish and got 6 pieces the size of what you see in my photos. Both of the guys ate two so it fed 4 of us, and I double the meat. Adjust the recipe accordingly for your family.        \n","Tags: Meat, European, < 60 Mins, Oven\n","Ingredients: zucchini, lean ground beef, onion, tomatoes, tomato paste, garlic clove, dried oregano, dried basil, dried thyme, water, pepper, egg, low fat cottage cheese, mozzarella cheese, flour\n","Steps: Cook zucchini until tender, drain and set aside.
