I thought the oven temp of 275&deg; sounded a little low, but this cake baked up (and rose) beautifully in my oven at this temp after pretty much exactly one hour. I do not know if the little &quot;freezer trick&quot; to this recipe is what ensured its moistness or not, but I did it, and it was exceptionally moist &amp; delicious. Would be interesting to see if it still came out as great if this step was skipped. All I know is that I followed this recipe EXACTLY as stated (except that I had no buttermilk, so I subbed with a mix of lemon juice &amp; milk) and I got exceptional results. So moist and yummy...a dense cake, similar in texture to a carrot cake... I personally would not call this frosted banana bread :o)  Depending on the amount of frosting you like you can decide whether to half the recipe or not. I used the full recipe and had some leftover. I sprinkled on the chopped walnuts and threw this baby in the fridge and cut it the next day...TO DIE FOR! I really liked it slightly chilled, but great at room temp too! It got better each day it sat, I always make this cake at least the day before I need or want it.  I was extremely pleased with this cake and will be making it over &amp; over again!! So glad I came across this one!! (on another website).\r\n\r\n\r\n(* * Just to update the recipe, (based on some of the reviews), the baking time may vary based on individual ovens.

It is wise to HAVE some fat added to the deer -- especially to ground deer. Maybe 25 % fat, ( I recommend 1 lb of ground venison, and 1/2 lb of deer sausage for fat content), otherwise your results will be poor. I don't know about some of the other game meat some are using. Please consult an expert. The recipe is delicious as it stands! Enjoy! Nita Holleman.", "Title: Jo Mama's World Famous Spaghetti\nDescription: My kids will give up a steak dinner for this spaghetti. It is a recipe I have been perfecting for years and it is so good (if I may humbly say) that my kids are disappointed when they eat spaghetti anywhere else but home! In fact they tell me I should open a restaurant and serve only this spaghetti and garlic bread. In response to requests, I have posted the recipe for Recipe #28559 that uses approximately 1/2 of the sauce from this \r\nrecipe. Have spaghetti one night and lasagna later!  Thanks to all of you who have tried my recipe and have written a review.  I read and appreciate every one of them!  Chef Note:  After I posted this recipe I remembered a funny incident--my dear husband usually has a nice bottle of wine handy so when I make a batch of spaghetti I just help myself to a splash of it. On one occasion, there wasn't a bottle opened, but there was a bottle sitting on the counter so I got out the corkscrew and helped myself. For some reason, the spaghetti that night was the best ever. My husband asked what wine I put in it and I showed him the bottle. He nearly fell off the chair. I had opened a rather expensive bottle he had bought to give his boss. Goes to show you--don't use a wine for cooking you wouldn't drink. You get the best results from a good wine!        \nTags: Pork, Meat, European, Kid Friendly, Weeknight, Stove Top, < 4 Hours, Easy\nIngredients: Italian sausage, onion, garlic cloves, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, water, basil, dried parsley flakes, brown sugar, salt, crushed red pepper flakes, fresh coarse ground black pepper, red wine, parmesan cheese\nSteps: In large, heavy stockpot, brown Italian sausage, breaking up as you stir., Add onions and continue to cook, stirring occasionally until onions are softened., Add garlic, tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce and water., Add basil, parsley, brown sugar, salt, crushed red pepper, and black pepper., Stir well and barely bring to a boil., Stir in red wine., Simmer on low, stirring frequently for at least an hour.

If you prefer a softer crust (like a traditional bread) mix the butter into the batter instead of pouring it over the top., Sifting flour for bread recipes is a must-do. Most people just scoop the 1 cup measure in the flour canister and level it off. That compacts the flour and will turn your bread into a \"hard biscuit\" as some have described. That's because they aren't sifting their flour! If you do not have a sifter, use a spoon to spoon the flour into the 1 cup measure. Try it once the \"correct\" way and you will see an amazing difference in the end product., I have had many email from you kind folks about using non-alcoholic beverages instead of beer. That is fine to do but I highly recommend adding a packet of Dry Active Yeast or 2 teaspoons of Bread (Machine) Yeast so that you get a proper rise., The final result should be a thick, hearty and very tasteful bread, NOT A BRICK! ;)., Thank you all for the incredibly nice comments and those of you who left a bad review - learn to sift sift SIFT!

It's simple and so good, and Tomoko, who is only 16, did such a good job of cooking this, then translating the recipe to English for me.\r\n\r\n*The liquid will thicken to a glaze if you are patient. It just takes a bit of time. If you feel your chicken is cooked (and going to overcook) remove it before going on to reduce the liquid. Same thing, if you must use breast meat, remove it (so it doesn't dry out) and continue reducing the liquid . If you do it this way rather than thickening with cornstarch you will get a richer glaze and not need to add stock or broth instead of the water. It just takes patience.

The chicken bakes out so moist and tender! Grated cheese may be sprinkled on top of the breast the last 5 minutes of cooking if desired but that is optional. Double all ingredients for more than four breasts and adjust the amount of garlic to suit taste. For the coating amount you might be able to get away with 5 or maybe 6 very small chicken breasts, but I would suggest to increase the amount slightly --- to take this dish to yet another level, about 10 minutes before the cooking time is finished, drizzle the top of the chicken with a little pasta sauce, then sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top. Return to oven for about 10 minutes until the chicken is completely cooked and sauce is hot and cheese has melted.

I hope you all enjoy them.        \nTags: High In..., < 30 Mins, Oven\nIngredients: unbleached all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder, kosher salt, salt, unsalted butter, buttermilk\nSteps: Preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F., Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl, or in the bowl of a food processor., Cut the butter into chunks and cut into the flour until it resembles course meal., If using a food processor, just pulse a few times until this consistency is achieved., Add the buttermilk and mix JUST until combined., If it appears on the dry side, add a bit more buttermilk. It should be very wet., Turn the dough out onto a floured board., Gently, gently PAT (do NOT roll with a rolling pin) the dough out until it's about 1/2\" thick. Fold the dough about 5 times, gently press the dough down to a 1 inch thick., Use a round cutter to cut into rounds., You can gently knead the scraps together and make a few more, but they will not be anywhere near as good as the first ones., Place the biscuits on a cookie sheet- if you like soft sides, put them touching each other., If you like\"crusty\" sides, put them about 1 inch apart- these will not rise as high as the biscuits put close together., Bake for about 10-12 minutes- the biscuits will be a beautiful light golden brown on top and bottom., Do not overbake., Note: The key to real biscuits is not in the ingredients, but in the handling of the dough., The dough must be handled as little as possible or you will have tough biscuits., I have found that a food processor produces superior biscuits, because the ingredients stay colder and there's less chance of overmixing., You also must pat the dough out with your hands, lightly., Rolling with a rolling pin is a guaranteed way to overstimulate the gluten, resulting in a tougher biscuit., Note 2: You can make these biscuits, cut them, put them on cookie sheets and freeze them for up to a month., When you want fresh biscuits, simply place them frozen on the cookie sheet and bake at 450\u00b0F for about 20 minutes.", "Title: Simply Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas\nDescription: Easy to assemble, deliciously creamy and a great choice for once-a-month cooking.

Skip the overnight refrigeration if you are in a hurry. For variety, eliminate the onion and substitute a quartered lemon or two, stuffed into the chicken cavity.  Chef Shapeweaver had a good suggestion:  Use Fajita Seasoning Mix #28011 as another variation.  Thanks!  The standard size slow cookers are a bit too small and a whole chicken won't fit.

The family was upset with me when I subbed an 8-oz. can of pizza sauce and told them to suck it up and call them 'Pizza Joes' and then served them up with shredded mozzarella cheese on the toasted buns, top and bottom.  They loved it.  I left out the BBQ sauce in this preparation and just used a 1/2 cup ketchup.

These can be done with baby back or regular pork ribs. I have also made split chickens this way. The ribs are tender, moist and just slide off of the bone. I know that your family will love them just as much as my family does.\r\nI noticed that some are unable to find hickory smoked salt. You can use smoked paprika or just brush the ribs with liquid smoke before applying the rub. The smoke flavor is nice because it helps give the ribs a cooked-on-the-grill flavor.\r\nAlso, the easiest way to remove the membrane is to work a spoon, or I use the tips of my kitchen shears, into the bottom center of the membrane, work it back and forth to form a &quot;pocket,&quot; then I slide my thumbs in and work the membrane off from the center outward to the ends.        \nTags: Meat, Broil/Grill, Oven, Beginner Cook, < 4 Hours, Easy\nIngredients: light brown sugar, hickory smoke salt, paprika, garlic powder, barbecue sauce\nSteps: Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.

I have watched these disappear time and again and everyone is always asking for the recipe. It is almost embarrassing to give it out, it is that easy :) Enjoy! (12/14/06: I wanted to add that Betty Crocker has updated this recipe by adding 1 tsp. vanilla extract, but I don't want to change the original recipe.) *12/22/07: Please see my tips at the end of the recipe! **12/23/08: Betty Crocker has now added a version of the same exact recipe in which the cookie dough balls are rolled in granulated sugar instead of powdered sugar.  I've tried this and they're also very good.        \nTags: Cookie & Brownie, Kid Friendly, Winter, Christmas, < 15 Mins, Oven, Beginner Cook, Easy, Inexpensive\nIngredients: eggs, confectioners' sugar, granulated sugar\nSteps: Preheat oven to 350\u00c2\u00b0., Stir (by hand) dry cake mix, oil and eggs in a large bowl until dough forms., Dust hands with confectioners' sugar and shape dough into 1\" balls., Roll balls in confectioners' sugar and place 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets., Bake for 8-10 minutes or until center is JUST SET., Remove from pans after a minute or so and cool on wire racks., *My Notes*:, I have tried these with several different cake mix brands.  They all come out good, but the Betty Crocker does come out the best., I was having a problem with my cookies flattening while baking.  This usually happens with the generic cake mix brands.  You can play with your oven temp and try them on 375 to keep them from spreading.  Adding more oil than called for will also cause the cookies to spread -- I wouldn't suggest it, they really don't need extra oil., Another way to keep them nice and thick and to get the most \"crinkled\" or \"crackled\" look is to make them bigger.  When I roll them at about 1.5 inches they look prettier., And my best tip:  My confectioners' sugar was consistently being absorbed by the dough.  The last time I baked them, I rolled them into balls without rolling in the sugar and let them \"dry\" for a few minutes.  Then I rolled them in sugar and baked.  These came out with a nice coating of sugar that didn't disappear.", "Title: Pork Chops Yum-Yum\nDescription: I copied this from The Orlando Sentinel months ago and just now found it.

If you double the recipe, you will need to cook longer than 20 minutes.", "Title: Mexican Rice\nDescription: Are you craving that great Mexican rice from your favorite taco stand? Here it is. This is just like a good Mexican restaurant rice. Many recipes taste good... but the texture just isn't right. You know how it is... you have prepared scores of Mexican rice recipes but always have been disappointed. It may be delicious but kinda &quot;gloopy and wet.&quot; Try this. Everything is pureed and cooked in. There are no chunks of anything... just dry fluffy rice with all the seasonings and just the tiniest hint of a tomato flavor. I will throw away all of my Mexican rice recipes- this is the one I have been looking for for years! \r\n\r\nI don't own a rice cooker but some people have had disappointing results using one. You will also need to adjust your cooking time if you want to use brown rice. I recommend following the cooking instructions as directed. Proceed at your own peril if you stray.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.        \nTags: Rice, Mexican, Lactose Free, Low Protein, Low Cholesterol, Free Of..., < 60 Mins, Inexpensive\nIngredients: tomatoes, long grain white rice, canola oil, minced garlic cloves, chicken broth, tomato paste, salt, fresh cilantro, lime\nSteps: Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350., Process tomato and onion in processor or blender until pureed and thoroughly smooth. Transfer mixture to measuring cup and reserve exactly 2 cups. Discard excess., Remove ribs and seeds from 2 jalapenos and discard. Mince flesh and set aside. Mince remaining jalapeno. Set aside., Place rice in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water until water runs clear- about 1 1/2 minutes.Shake rice vigorously to remove excess water.This step removes the starch from the rice so it will not stick. IF YOU OMIT THIS STEP YOUR RICE WILL NOT BE DRY AND FLUFFY., Heat oil in heavy bottomed ovensafe 12 inch straight sided sautee pan or Dutch oven with tight fitting lid over low-medium heat about 2 minutes. (The recipe is very specific about this but I used a 10 inch dutch oven and it worked out fine.) Drop a few rice grains in and if they sizzle then it is ready. Add rice and fry stirring until rice is light golden and translucent, about 6-8 minutes.  Be careful that the oil doesn't get too hot too fast or the oil will splatter., Reduce heat to medium, add garlic and 2 minced jalapenos and cook , stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 1/2 minutes., Stir in broth, pureed mixture,tomato paste, and salt. Increase heat to medium high, and bring to a boil., Cover pan and transfer pan to oven to bake until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, 30-35 minutes.Stir well after 15 minutes., Stir in cilantro, minced jalapeno to taste, and pass lime wedges separately., Edited to add 6-15-05: If you can't get good fresh tomatoes you are better off using canned tomatoes. Don't use those awful hard and underipe tomatoes that are at most supermarket chains. Just be sure that the processed tomatoes and the one onion equals 2 cups. One the other hand- if you find that after processing your tomatoes and onions that you have less than 2 cups- simply add enough bottled salsa to make up the difference., Edited 8-21-06: Do not skip any of the steps. It may seem stupid- but rinsing the rice to remove the starch is very important if you want fluffy rice. It will only take two minutes of your time but it makes the difference., Edited 8-15-08: Leftovers are just as delicious the next day so this is a perfect dish to make ahead time for potlucks. This rice also freezes well. For Freezing Ahead: Cool, portion and freeze in a ziploc bag. To reheat from frozen: Place in a pyrex dish and warm in the microwave, stirring every 2-3 minutes until heated through., You'll love this rice! Money back guarantee.", "Title: Pulled Pork (Crock Pot)\nDescription: I found this pulled pork recipe years ago, and it's a favorite at potlucks. Freezes well for easy quick meals.        \nTags: Meat, Healthy, Beginner Cook, Easy\nIngredients: onions, ginger ale, barbecue sauce, barbecue sauce\nSteps: Slice one onion and place in crock pot., Put in the roast and cover with the other onion, sliced. Pour over the ginger ale. Cover and cook on LOW for about 12 hours. See Note2 below regarding amount of time needed!, Remove the meat, strain and save the onions, discard all liquid. With two forks, shred the meat, discarding any remaining fat, bones or skin. Most of the fat will have melted away., Return the shredded meat and the onions to the crock pot, stir in the barbecue sauce. Continue to cook for another 4 to 6 hours on LOW., Serve with hamburger buns or rolls and additional barbecue sauce. Any leftovers freeze very well., TIP: freeze ready-made sandwiches - a scoop of meat on a bun, well-wrapped. These make a great quick meal or snack. To reheat, remove wrapping, wrap in a paper towel, and zap 1-2 minute in the microwave., Note: Shoulder or butt are recommended because the meat shreds very well. Other cuts do not shred as readily. It is a fattier cut, but the fat melts away in the cooking and is poured away when you discard the liquid., Note 2: I have an older, smaller crock pot. The above times work perfectly for me. But if you have a newer or bigger crock pot, you may need to revise times downward, esp. after the bbq sauce is added. I think you need at least a couple of hours for it all to meld, but that may be all you need. Update: I recently bought a bigger crockpot, I think 5 or 6 qts. I cooked a 6 lb pork shoulder in it for 8 hours and it was shreddable at that point. Shredded, added the sauce, and cooked for another hour or so to meld everything. So use your best judgment on timing!, Note3: You might want to turn your roast over after it's cooked a while, to ensure more even cooking. I think this may depend on the size and shape of your roast and the size of your slow cooker. Remember that each time you remove the lid you lose heat and be careful, as turning a large piece of meat is awkward., Note4: my sister says this takes 2 hours in the Instapot.  I don't have one, up to you to figure out the steps.", "Title: Kittencal's 5-Minute Cinnamon Flop Brunch Cake\nDescription: Except for the the milk and small amount in the egg, the cake itself has very little fat and using low-fat milk will keep the fat to a minimum, I have stated the egg as optional, I strongly suggest to add it in for a more cake-like texture --  If you are looking for a fancy cake to serve then this is not it however for the ease of this cake it is darn good and makes a great weekend brunch cake, it's like a combination of a cake and cinnamon bun all in one,  ridiculously simple to make as it's all mixed by hand and takes like 5 minutes to throw together, try adding in some chopped strawberries, apples or blueberries, raisins or dried cranberries, this recipe is a blank canvas, so go ahead and add in fruit, nuts chocolate chips whatever you wish, and to kick this up a notch drizzle recipe#120835 on top :) --- servings are only estimated        \nTags: Healthy, Christmas, Brunch, < 30 Mins, Inexpensive\nIngredients: all-purpose flour, sugar, milk, vanilla, baking powder, salt, egg, brown sugar, cinnamon, butter, walnuts, pecans\nSteps: Set oven to 350 degrees F., Prepare a greased 13 x 9-inch baking dish, or two 8 or 9-inch round cake pans (although the batter will seem like it will fit into only one 8 or 9-inch pan, this flop rises very high and will run over the sides if baked in just one pan)., In a bowl mix the 2 cups flour, 1-1/4 cups white sugar, milk, vanilla or almond extract, baking powder, pinch of salt and egg (if using) until just combined careful not to overmix., Pour into prepared baking pan/s., Generously spread brown sugar and cinnamon on top., If desired sprinkle chopped walnuts or pecans over top., Drizzle melted butter over top., Bake for about 20-25 minutes for 8 or 9-inch round cake pan, and about 30 minutes for a 13 x 9-inch pan.", "Title: Greek Potatoes (Oven-Roasted and Delicious!)\nDescription: These potatoes are a staple in our home.

ANSWER:  So long as the tenderloins are NOT touching each other, cook 3 or 4 individual tenderloins for the same amount of time as if you were cooking one.  Remember, each tenderloin is cooking in its own separate space.  EXAMPLE:  If cooking three 1-pound tenderloins, cook them only 5-1/5 minutes TOTAL.

Adjust +/- according to your oven's accuracy and heat retention. NOTE:, IF YOU HAVE AN OVEN PROBE OR THERMOMETER THAT HAS A WIRE THAT GOES THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE OVEN DOOR, BY ALL MEANS USE IT AND SET THE TEMPERATURE ALARM FOR 140 DEGREES.  REMOVE MEAT FROM OVEN WHEN ALARM ALERT GOES OFF (probably before an hour has expired)., Turn oven OFF and DO NOT open oven door for 45 to 1 hour, OR sooner IF you are using a probe thermometer and it alerts that internal meat temp is at 140 degrees.

Roast should be done, very slightly pink in the center, and very moist., After resting 10 minutes, the roast should reach a safe 145-150 degrees., NOTE:******* For anyone questioning this method of cooking, it really does reach the proper internal temperature on a thermometer.  According to Sara Moulton on FoodTV, trichinosos is killed at 138 degrees, and 145 is a safe temperature for pork, although the USDA recommends 160 degrees (meat will be much drier).

This is even better than the BEST I have had in my fave Chinese restaurant. To make the meal go quickly prep everything the day or night before and store in the fridge. To make this easy to understand I have changed the terms to cornstarch slurry and sauce. The first is used to coat the chicken for frying, the second to coat the fried chicken. HTH I use a grater with small holes for the garlic or you can just zip all the sauce ingredients up in a blender or food processor. Enjoy! NOTE: I really appreciate all the reviews this recipe has received. I know that when making this it seems strange and like it just is not going to work. Trust that it will work even though the method and the way that the cornstarch slurry acts before cooking are so different. I was the same way the first time I made this. It does result in crispy pieces of chicken that are so like you find in a restaurant. The heat here is pretty much a balanced amount because some like it hot and some do not. Taste and add more heat as desired. Thanks again for trying this recipe. I hope that you have the great results that I have had time and again. Here is info, pics and heat levels of different chilies. http://www.foodsubs.com/Chilefre.html        \nTags: Chicken, Poultry, Meat, Asian, < 60 Mins, Deep Fried, Inexpensive\nIngredients: boneless skinless chicken breasts, green onions, soy sauce, egg, cornstarch, cornstarch, water, fresh garlic, sugar, soy sauce, white vinegar, sherry wine, white wine, chicken broth\nSteps: Place sauce ingredients in a quart jar with a lid and shake to mix. If you make this ahead of time just refrigerate until needed, shaking it again when you are ready to use it. This also keeps your dirty dishes down., Mix cornstarch slurry in a large bowl- the mixture will be strange but trust me it works. It will be VERY thick almost paste like. Add ALL the chicken pieces and stir to coat. Using a fork remove ONE chicken piece at a time and let the excess mixture drip off. YES even though the mixture has a weird consistency it will not stick like paste and the excess will drip off. Add chicken to the hot (350 degree) oil and fry until crispy. Only cook 7 or 8 chicken pieces at a time. You do not want to lower the temp of the oil by cooking too many at a time. You can use a simple cooking or candy thermometer to judge the temp of the oil., Drain on paper towels. Want them extra crispy? Put them on a rack over a sheet pan. Keep warm- I just put them in the oven with the oven off. Repeating until all chicken is fried., In a separate wok or large skillet add a small amount of oil and heat to 400 degrees. Again, a candy thermometer works great. (Want less dishes?  You can just drain the oil after you fry all the chicken, leave a small amount (about a tsp) in the pan and use the same pan if you like.), Add green onions and hot peppers and stir fry about 30 seconds., Stir (or shake jar) sauce mixture, and then add to pan with onions and peppers, cook until thick. Some reviews didn't kniw what \"thick\" meant. Thick like the same sauce you get at a restaurant.you want it to just coat the chicken. If it gets too thick, add a little water or other liquid. The thickness of the sauce should be similar to what you get when ordering this at a restaurant., Add chicken to sauce in wok and heat just until the chicken is hot enough for you. It may not even need a minute if you kept the chicken warm. The quicker you serve it the crispier the chicken stays., Don't be scared by any negative reviews. It's not rocket science though if you have never cooked with a cornstarch slurry it may feel like an experiment. Trust yourself! You've got this! If you have any doubts reread the recipe and get everything in order before you start to cook. I promise you will thank yourself and maybe even me!

The thinner the slices, the quicker they cook and the tastier they are., You do not have to turn the sliced potatoes over., If you do not have a bacon tray, use a microwave safe casserole dish., Rub the inside of the dish with some olive oil for the first batch of potato chips., I do not know why, but I find that if you do not rub oil the first time, some chips will tend to stick to the dish., After the first batch is done, you do not have to rub the dish again., Continue to microwave the remainder of sliced potatoes as noted above., If using a bacon tray, after the first batch is cooked, you can reduce the microwaving time to 4 1/2 minutes and even less as you continue to microwave each batch., NOTE:  You can also use PARCHMENT PAPER to microwave the potato slices.  Lightly spray or rub the parchment paper with some vegetable oil or a Pam spray. Place your potato slices on the parchment paper, then sprinkle them with whatever you like and then place another piece of parchment paper on top.

It was a good thing I had an extra cut-up chicken in the refrigerator because my family was begging for it again the next day. Although it calls for what seems like a lot of hot pepper sauce, it isn't any spicier than Jack-In-the Box's Spicy Crispy Chicken--you can take it!!  FYI I made this using 10 pounds of wings--enough of the hot sauce/egg mixture to cover, but you will need to double flour mixture if you want to do this much.

We do about 1/4 cup a time for small, easy-to-flip pancakes but you could make this as much as 1/2 cup of pancake mix., If you are adding fruit, I like to sprinkle it on top of the pancake now., When the pancake starts to bubble on top and is golden brown on the cooked side, turn it and continue cooking until both sides are golden brown., The first pancake is always a bit of a test so adjust the batter by adding more flour if you need to make it thicker or more milk if you want a thinner pancake. In either case, just add a few spoonfuls at a time until you get it right., Repeat the cooking process with the remaining batter. You may need to adjust the heat as pan tends to get hotter as you keep making pancakes., Keep the cooked pancakes covered with a tea towel, to keep them warm while you finish cooking the rest.", "Title: Soft Molasses Cookies\nDescription: OK, Your cookie jar will be SO empty when you make these.

The loosemeat was created in 1924 at Ye Old Tavern-now Gus' Family Restaurant on 14th and Jackson St. in Sioux City, Iowa. Nowadays you will find the original sandwich served at Bob's Drive Inn on Hwy 75, LeMars, Iowa just a mile or so out of Sioux City, at The Tastee Inn and Out, on Gordon Drive and at Miles Inn on Leech Ave. among others. If you see a recipe for loosemeats that contains tomato juice-run! A loosemeat is a sloppy joe without the slop-so stay away from anything tomato-ey please! These little sandwiches are great for football parties, slumber parties, with a cold beer on a sunny summer day, or just anytime you want a real taste of Americana cooking that takes just a few minutes with very little cleanup. These are typical Iowa tavern fare. I loved these sandwiches so much when I was a kid and one day I ran into my Grandma's tavern and asked for my usual &quot;tavern&quot;. They always came served with a thin sheet of restaurant paper under them. I was so eager I ate my sandwich half way gone before I realized I was eating the paper too:-) After cooking these in the kitchen they were transferred to a portable steamer. This is the original recipe for the little dudes that were served in the Midwest. I cannot account for changes or differences in flavor for other regions of the country, east or west.  I learned to make my Grandma's version when I came to spend summers with her in Sioux City between 1958-65. She's the reason I've become a diehard foodie, a &quot;from scratch&quot; cook.  My Grandma was a fearless woman who wasn't afraid to tread in unfamiliar waters. In so many ways food brings people together. I had no idea these little sandwiches would be so loved and bring such happiness to people. I've been so touched by the messages I've received from folks who've tried this recipe and then shared their memories w/me! Thanks!!

It is very moist and a little heavy type banana bread. The really important thing to remember is using all black bananas to get my same results. I always use 5 medium sized bananas and this recipe makes 2 loaves. Also, I've never used buttermilk, but sour milk instead..a little vinegar added to regular milk. I've used this recipe since 1972 and last year made 32 loaves to give away for Christmas! It's truly a wonderful bread. I only bake it until the toothpick comes out almost clean, as we like it really moist. If you over bake it, or wait til the toothpick is completely clean, the bread will be a lot dryer. I realize some like it this way, so thats why I've given this hint. My family and friends would rather have it a little under done than over. It's so good with coffee, butter/jelly or I like mine just plain. I bake it in tin foil pans and it freezes wonderfully. I try to always have one or two in the freezer for company, or a little gift. This recipe came from a ladies club cookbook. The kind where everyone contributes recipes, they are made into a recipe book and sold to make money for charities.

I've read that roaster ovens effectively 'steam' the turkey making the meat come out ... well, steamed.  This is not true. Follow these tips and your holiday turkey will get rave reviews!        \nTags: Poultry, Meat, Roast, For Large Groups, Oven, Easy\nIngredients: olive oil, butter, seasoning salt, poultry seasoning, pepper\nSteps: Take the insert pan out of the roaster and pre-heat the roaster to its highest setting. On mine it's 450, but use 500 if your oven goes that high., Do not wash the turkey!  The USDA says that washing it could cause a spread of salmonella poisoning.  Sprinkle salt in the cavities. Stuff if desired.  Don\u2019t pre-stuff your turkey; mix and stuff ingredients immediately before roasting. Tossing in a few pieces of cut fruit or herbs is not considered 'stuffing.'  Stuffing usually means filling up the cavity with about \u00be cup stuffing per pound of turkey., Rub the entire bird with olive oil or butter. Doctor up your bird with whatever special seasonings you wish.  I always use poultry seasoning. Finish with a good sprinkle of seasoning salt and black pepper., I highly recommend using a wired thermometer so you can watch the temperature without lifting the lid.  Your turkey will be done much earlier than the estimated cook time, so keep a sharp eye on that thermometer.  If using a pop-up turkey plug type thermometer, those little pop-ups stick sometimes so you should really use two of them., Put the rack into the insert pan and make sure the handles are up, not tucked below.  Put the bird in the insert pan on top of the rack.  Don\u2019t add water to the pan. Put the insert pan back into the roasting pan.  If your roaster doesn't have an insert pan, it's ok - just be very careful putting the bird into that hot oven, you don't want to burn your hands on the sides of the oven! Cover., Roast at highest setting for 30 minutes.  The butter/oil, seasonings and the searing time will make the skin beautifully browned and perfect!, After 30 minutes, turn the oven temperature down to 325., The turkey will self-baste if you do not lift the lid, so you don't have to baste it every 20 minutes like you do in your conventional oven. DO NOT LIFT LID during cooking time!  Lifting the lid will increase cooking time because roaster ovens lose their heat unlike regular ovens.   I've read that roaster ovens effectively 'steam' the turkey making the meat come out  --  well, steamed.  This is not true as you will find out.  Similar to the roasted chickens you can get at your supermarket, the bird will come out moist and perfectly roasted.  Why do you think they call it a Roaster Oven?., Figure your total cooking time from the time you first put the bird in the roaster.  The Butterball website has a great calculator:, http://www.butterball.com/calculators-and-conversions., FINAL TEMPERATURE FOR SAFETY AND DONENESS IS: 180 DEGREES IN THIGH AND 165 DEGREES IN BREAST AND STUFFING. Juices should be clear, not pink., Check your turkey EARLY.  Really start watching the temp an hour before it's supposed to be done. Your turkey will almost certainly be done before the suggested cooking time.  Watch your wired meat thermometer.  If using a pop-up turkey plug type thermometer, check by lifting the lid quickly so the oven doesn\u2019t lose its heat.  If necessary, check after another 30 minutes, but I doubt you'll have to do that.  I say check after 30 minutes because it's really OK to let the bird roast a little extra - you won't dry it out using my method if you let it go for 1/2 hour., When done, remove the turkey from the roaster, tent with foil, and let rest for 20 minutes.  This allows the juices to really seep into the meat, so they say., If you try this method, please let us know your results!, Happy Thanksgiving everyone!", "Title: Chicken Cordon Bleu Casserole\nDescription: My family loved this recipe.

After much searching these are the ones we deemed &quot;best&quot;. Soft and chewy but with a lightly crisp outer layer. If you don't want the crispness, substitute more butter for the shortening. \r\n\r\nI have found that you need to follow the directions *exactly* to get the best cookies. Not using real butter or all brown sugar, not beating the eggs in one at a time, not baking them at a higher temp than the &quot;traditional&quot; recipe, all make a difference in the end result. \r\n\r\nI have also found that Land o' Lake butter makes a better cookie than some generic brand butter. Don't let the butter sit out too long. It needs to soften but if it sits until the moisture starts to separate from the butter, it is too soft and it will affect the resulting cookies. If that happens, refrigerate the dough for about an hour to help them not spread as much. It also helps to use the mixer on the dough in between batches going into the oven. It helps keep the dough from starting to separate if it is a warm day. \r\n\r\nAnother thing I've learned is you have to make sure there is plenty of circulation in your oven. When I moved, my cookies started turning out flat again. I finally realized that my oven was smaller at the new house and when I switched to smaller cookie sheets, my cookies turned out perfectly!        \nTags: Chocolate Chip Cookies, Dessert, Cookie & Brownie, < 30 Mins, For Large Groups\nIngredients: all-purpose flour, baking soda, salt, real butter, shortening, brown sugar, vanilla, eggs\nSteps: Mix flour, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl., In a separate bowl, beat butter and shortening until creamy., Add sugar and vanilla and beat with a mixer on medium speed until well blended., Beat in eggs, one at a time, mixing well., Add flour mixture, and beat slowly to incorporate, then beat to blend well., Stir in chocolate chips and nuts., Drop batter in 2-tablespoon portions about 2 inches apart on baking sheets., Bake in a 375\u00b0F preheated oven until edges of cookies are brown but an area about 1 inch wide in the center is still pale, about 10 minutes., If using 2 pans in 1 oven, switch positions at half-time., Let cookies cool on pan about 5 minutes, then transfer to racks with a spatula., Serve warm or cool.", "Title: Best Pumpkin Cookies\nDescription: What can I say about these amazing pumpkin cookies... they are absolutely delicious! Let me put it this way. I baked these every year at Thanksgiving time for my job. My co-workers would come up to me two months in advance to make sure I was making them. One girl who resigned actually called me and asked what day I was bringing them in so that she could stop by - just for these cookies! Another co-worker said she didn't even like pumpkin, but she loved these. The consistency is more cake-like than cookie. The glaze on top of these cookies is fabulous! At least, I think so.

Cook, stirring constantly, for one minute or until slightly thickened. Beat in the milk. Blend in confectioner's sugar until the glaze is smooth and spreadable. Using a silicone basting brush, which I love and use religiously now, or a butter knife to spread glaze on cookies is the best tip. Please note; this glaze will harden fairly quickly. I suggest that you keep the saucepan over the stove on the lowest heat possible to prevent it from hardening.", "Title: Best Ever Tuna Noodle Casserole\nDescription: This is a recipe my entire family loves!

It is great all year around - served with flat breads or pitta breads &amp; assorted salads in spring &amp; summer or served with hot fluffy &amp; fruity couscous, assorted chutneys or pickles in the depths of winter.

Try it out! If you cannot get Ras-el-Hanout, which is an exotic Moroccan spice mixture, including rose petals - don't worry, use the other spices I have listed instead; or I have a Ras-el-Hanout recipe posted on Recipezaar: Recipe #205185\r\nN.B.
